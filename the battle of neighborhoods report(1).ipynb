As for advanced information tis will provide us with the category of the venue ,its popularity and maybe the average price of the services and so on."

After this stage, the column \"Venue's Category\" became One-hot encoded and different venues had different feature-columns. After On-hot encoding we then integrated all restaurant columns to one column \"Total Restaurants\" and all food joint columns to \"Total Joints\" column. "
